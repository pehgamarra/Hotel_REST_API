Hi, I'm Pedro Gamarra, the developer. This REST API model of one (site) to many (hotels) has a published database on Postman: (https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/36528434/2sA3kSoiDP)
If you want to test this back-end application, run it with the database.




This application allows you to store many hotels within a single site and many sites within a single site, like a search engine. 
You can filter by most expensive, cheapest, most stars, least stars, in a model similar to Trivago (I'm not sure if it exists in other countries). 
*I developed this application as part of the course REST APIs with Python.*
